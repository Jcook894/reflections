  How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

  It helped me see the bug by putting the 2 files together and pointing out the
  the changes in the files. Instead of going through each file looking for the
  error.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

  Having an easy access to the entire history of a file will make me a better programmer
  by having the ability to look back on how the file originally looked liked if further edits where
  done to it.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

  The pros of being able to manually commit because you can create a commit whenever you feel is necessary.
  But the downside of being able to commit manually is that you never know when a commit could be too big or too small

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

  I think that git allows users to save multiple files in git so you are able to put in your repository
  and also make it easier too commit the files instead of going through each file and saving it.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

 By using those commands I am able too view all the commits made too the files and even
 compare each commits done to that file.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

  Using version control makes me more confident to make changes that could break something
  by letting me go back to what the original file was before the bug and be able to see where I went wrong
  and fix it.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

  I would like to use git to help me start building websites and begin my career as a front end web
  developer!
