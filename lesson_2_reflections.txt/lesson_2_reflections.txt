      What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
        When you initialize a repository your able to start making commits in on the files.
        It shows the hidden .git files as well.

      How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
      What value do you think it offers?

        The staging area is different from the working directory and the repository
        by being able to pick and choose which files to be committed. I think this
        is very helpful because you can bundle a couple of files to be committed or a
        single file depending on your preference.


      How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
      change?

            The staging are helps me make sure I make a commit per logical change by
            putting the files you have worked instead of just committing everything all at once.


      What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
      organized? How would branches help?
            Branches would help me keep my history organized by keeping my master branch
            and being able to create other branches too try something different or start a new
            code

      How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

        The diagrams helped me visualize the branch structure by showing me how the recent commit has
        a parent commit and you can trace that commit to the initial commit.


      What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
      the diagram the way we do?

          The result of merging two branches together is that they combine both of the branches history
          and they sort them by the time they were committed. It is better represented in a diagram because
          you can show which branches have certain commits or which branches are merged, even follow the
          diagram to the first commit made.


      What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
      manually?

          The pros of automatically merging is that it will take the files and put them together without going in
          and changing the files by hand. but you may come across 2 different changes and its hard for it to merge.
