      How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
      What value do you think it offers?

        The staging area is different from the working directory and the repository
        by being able to pick and choose which files to be committed. I think this
        is very helpful because you can bundle a couple of files to be committed or a
        single file depending on your preference.


      How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
      change?

            The staging are helps me make sure I make a commit per logical change by
            putting the files you have worked instead of just committing everything all at once.
