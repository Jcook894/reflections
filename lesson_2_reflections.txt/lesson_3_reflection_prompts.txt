When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
    I would want to use a remote file so I can share my work with other people and have them give theyre input and help with
    the code process.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Sometimes it would be best to manually pull changes because you may have writing a lot of code
    or someone else had added to that file and might not be in your local yet.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    The difference between forks, clones, and branches are that forks are pretty much clone of
    someone else's repository without actually adding or taking away from the original repo. Clones are
    just copys of someone else files, codes, and commits that your can see from your computer. Branches are
    just commits that you can go back too and check out the code.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    The benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote is that you
    can easily add to the remote without going back and forth merging.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I would try to figure out other version-control or copy and paste different files and save them in
    different directories lol. I think it would be a lot harder git is great at version control, I
    wouldn't know what to use if it wasn't for git.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
